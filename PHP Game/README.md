## PHP Two-Player Board Game

The PHP Two-Player Board Game is a PHP-based web game inspired by Ludo. Players navigate a 3x3 board, rolling dice to advance their positions. Landing on the same non-safe spot "kills" players, sending them back to the starting position. The first player to reach the end wins.
